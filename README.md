# Horiseon - Challenge 1

## Overview

In this challenge, I was asked to refactor starting code in order for the website to meet accesibility standards.

## Changes

I reviewed the starting code and added semantic HTML elements using what I have learned. That involved changing tags, classes, and disposing of css that was not necessary.
